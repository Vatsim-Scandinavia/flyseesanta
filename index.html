                VATSIM Scandinavia welcomes you to fly and see the original Santa Claus and his home just before the
                Christmas Holiday.
                <br><br>
                Fly and See Santa is the biggest annual Christmas event in VATSIM skies and is held at three airports in
                the northernmost part of Europe. Snowy landscapes and slippery runways greet you during this magical
                event at Rovaniemi, Tromsø and Kiruna, which we hope you will enjoy as well. All three airports are
                located in the beautiful nature and wilderness of northern Europe. During December, the airspace is
                crowded with santa flights with passengers excited to visit the North.

                Rovaniemi airport started operations in 1940. Having been destroyed during the war, reconstruction started and operations resumed in 1948. By the early 1980's, the airport had become home to Lapland Air Command's Fighter Squadron 11 and the runway extended to its current length. A new terminal building was completed in the year 2000.
                <br><br>
                The airport's scheduled traffic consists mostly of domestic flights, but in addition there are a number of charter flights (especially during the winter season), general aviation activity, Border Guard helicopters and naturally lots of military aircraft.

                Kiruna Airport is Sweden’s northernmost airport and is situated around 9 km from the city centre. On a regular basis SAS and Norwegian flies daily, connecting Kiruna with Stockholm. During the winter the airport sees numerous charter flights with passengers wanting to see the northern lights and most likely the famous Ice Hotel as well.
                <br><br>
                Due to its location in northern Sweden with its cold climate and the fact that the airspace around is quite calm, it makes it a popular airport for scientific research. NASA, Boeing and Airbus are some of the regular visitors when testing new airframes or technology.
